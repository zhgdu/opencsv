     * had been specified.</p>
     * <p>The regular expression will be compiled and every field of input will
     * be passed through it, naturally after the input has been normalized
     * (quotations and escape characters removed). The first capture group will
     * be extracted, and that string will be passed on to the appropriate
     * conversion routine for the bean field in question.</p>
     * <p>This makes it possible to easily convert input fields with forms like
     * {@code Grade: 94.2} into {@code 94.2}, which can then be converted to a
     * floating point bean field, all without writing a custom converter.</p>
     * <p>The regular expression is applied to the entire string in question
     * (i.e. with {@link Matcher#matches()}), instead of just the beginning of
     * the string ({@link Matcher#lookingAt()}) or anywhere in the string
     * ({@link Matcher#find()}). If it fails to match, the input string is
     * passed unchanged to the appropriate conversion routine for the bean
     * field. The reason for this is two-fold:</p>
     * <ol><li>The matching may occur against an empty string. If the field is
     * not required, this is legitimate, but it's likely the regular expression
     * is not written to accommodate this possibility, and it may indeed not be
     * at all desirable to.</li>
     * <li>If there is an error in either the regular expression or the input
     * that causes the match to fail, there is a good likelihood that the
     * subsequent conversion will fail with a
     * {@link com.opencsv.exceptions.CsvDataTypeMismatchException} if the
     * input is not being converted into a simple string.</li></ol>
